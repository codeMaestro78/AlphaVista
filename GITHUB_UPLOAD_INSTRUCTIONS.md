# How to Upload Your Stock Analysis Dashboard to GitHub

## Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in to your account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Name your repository: `stock-analysis-dashboard`
4. Add a description: "Interactive stock analysis dashboard with Yahoo Finance integration"
5. Make it Public (or Private if you prefer)
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these files)
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Download Your Project Files

From your Replit project, download these files to your local computer:

### Main Application Files:
- `app.py` - Main Streamlit application
- `utils/data_processor.py` - Data processing utilities
- `utils/chart_generator.py` - Chart generation utilities
- `.streamlit/config.toml` - Streamlit configuration

### Project Documentation:
- `README.md` - Complete project documentation
- `LICENSE` - MIT License file
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules
- `requirements-github.txt` - Python dependencies for GitHub users

### Optional Files:
- `generated-icon.png` - Project icon (if you want to include it)

## Step 3: Upload to GitHub via Command Line

Open terminal/command prompt in your project folder and run:

```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Stock Analysis Dashboard with Yahoo Finance integration"

# Add GitHub repository as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/stock-analysis-dashboard.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 4: Alternative - Upload via GitHub Web Interface

If you prefer using the web interface:

1. Go to your new repository on GitHub
2. Click "uploading an existing file"
3. Drag and drop all your project files
4. Write a commit message: "Initial commit: Stock Analysis Dashboard"
5. Click "Commit changes"

## Step 5: Verify Your Upload

After uploading, your repository should contain:
- Complete project structure
- Working Streamlit application
- Comprehensive README with installation instructions
- All utility modules for data processing and charting

## Next Steps

1. Test your repository by cloning it to a new location
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements-github.txt`
3. Run the app: `streamlit run app.py`
4. Add collaborators or make it public for others to use
